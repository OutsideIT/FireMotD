# Fire MotD Generator for displaying custom system information

### Idea

This tool displays useful system information after logging into a Linux system (or Windows with FireMotD.ps1), such as version, CPU information, 
memory, disk information, number of updates, and many more useful things. 

### Status

The original maintainer of FireMotD is stepping down. As of 2024-01-01, this project is no longer maintained by the original author. The OutsideIT GitHub project will be closed.
The community is encouraged to fork, modify, and maintain their own versions of FireMotD if wanted.
