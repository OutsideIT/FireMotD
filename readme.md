Note:
 Some functionalities may require superuser privileges. Eg. check for updates.
 If you have problems, try something like:
 sudo /home/tavinus/FireMotD/FireMotD -S
```

### System Install

You need to have `make` installed on the system, if you want to use the Makefile.

##### To install to /usr/local/bin/FireMotD
```bash
sudo make install
```
With this you can probably run FireMotD from anywhere in your system. If not, you need to add `/usr/local/bin` to your `$PATH` variable. To adjust the installation path, change the var `IDIR=/usr/local/bin` in the Makefile to the path you want.

##### To install bash autocompletion support
```bash
sudo make bash_completion
```
With this you can use TAB to autocomplete parameters and options with FireMotD.
Does not require the sudo make install above (system install), but requires the `bash-completion` package to be installed and working. Then you should logout-login or source the bash completion file, eg. `$ . /etc/bash_completion.d/FireMotD`  

If you don't have root access, just install everything on your user's folder and source the file from your user's .profile file

### Crontab to get system updates count

This is an example on how to record the system update package count daily.  
This will update the file `/var/tmp/updatecount.txt` for later access.  
Root privilege is required for this operation. 
Only /etc/crontab and the files in /etc/cron.d/ have a username field.
 
##### So there you can do this:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/crontab
# FireMotD system updates check (randomly execute between 0:00:00 and 5:59:59)
0 0 * * * root perl -e 'sleep int(rand(21600))' && /usr/local/bin/FireMotD -S &>/dev/null
```

##### From root's crontab you can use:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
# FireMotD system updates check (randomly execute between 0:00:00 and 5:59:59)
0 0 * * * perl -e 'sleep int(rand(21600))' && /usr/local/bin/FireMotD -S &>/dev/null
```

### Apt configuration to update updates count

On systems with apt (Debian, Ubuntu, ...) add the following configuration lines to refresh the updates count after an apt action (install, remove, ...) was performed.

Create the apt configuration file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/15firemotd` containing:
```bash
DPkg::Post-Invoke {
  "if [ -x /usr/local/bin/FireMotD ]; then echo -n 'Updating FireMotD available updates count ... '; /usr/local/bin/FireMotD -S; echo ''; fi";
};
```

### Adding FireMotD to run on login

Choosing where to run your script is kind of situational. Some files will only run on remote logins, other local logins, or even both. You should find out what suits best your needs on each case.

##### To add FireMotD to a single user
Edit the user's `~/.profile` file, `~/.bash_profile` file, or the `~/.bashrc` file
```bash
nano ~/.profile
```

Add the FireMotD call at the end of the file (choose your theme)
```bash
/usr/local/bin/FireMotD -t red
```

##### To add FireMotD to all users
You may call FireMotD from a few different locations for running globally.  
Eg.` /etc/bash.bashrc`, `/etc/profile`.  

You may also create a initialization script `init.sh` which will call the `FireMotD` script in `/etc/profile.d` when logging in. You can put whatever you like in this init.sh script. Everything in it will be executed at the moment someone logs in your system. Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
 
/usr/local/bin/FireMotD --Theme Red
```
